Difference between array of pointers and pointer to an array

Pointer to an array stores the address of any given array
Array of pointers is an array of multiple pointer variables

Pointer to an array: datatype (*var_name)[size_of_array];
Array of pointers: datatype *var_name[array_size];

Pointer to an array is also known as array pointers
Array of pointers is also known as pointer arrays.

Difference between structure and union

Structure: struct keyword is used
Union: union keyword is used

Structure: Each data members is assigned with different memory locations
Union: All the data members is assigned with same memory lacations

Structure: Altering the value of a member will not affect other data members
Union: Aletring the value of a member will effect other data members

 Why do we need character pointer in implementation of sizeof operator?
Typecasting the variable is to char pointer is required, because when we perform pointer arithmetic, it increments or decrements by 1 and it tells that how many character variables can be placed in that locations

Difference between strcpy and memcpy

strcpy is used to data of one string into another string 
memcpy is used to copy specified number of bytes one memnory to another

strcpy acts on data
memcpy acts on memory

In strcpy, length need not be specified. It stops when it encounters \0 character.
In memcpy, length used to be specified.

strcpy: char *strcpy(char *Dest, const char *Src);
memcpy: void * memcpy(void *Dest, const void *Src, size_t numBytes);
